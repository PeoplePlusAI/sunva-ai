# Examples

Text: Hey, how's it going? I just wanted to catch up and see what you've been up to lately. Did you watch any good movies or TV shows recently? I've been binge-watching this new series on Netflix, and it's pretty addictive. Oh, and I tried that new restaurant downtown last weekend – the food was amazing! We should totally go there sometime. Anyway, let me know what's new with you!

Response: True

Text: The purpose of this study was to investigate the effects of sleep deprivation on cognitive performance. A sample of 100 participants was divided into two groups: one that received a full night's sleep and another that stayed awake for 24 hours. The participants were then given a series of cognitive tasks to measure their performance. The results showed a significant decline in cognitive performance for the sleep-deprived group compared to the well-rested group. These findings suggest that adequate sleep is crucial for optimal cognitive functioning.

Response: False

In this example, the text contains important information about a study on sleep deprivation and its effects on cognitive performance. Summarizing this text may result in the loss of key details and findings, so it should be kept in its original form.
